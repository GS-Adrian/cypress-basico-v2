# cypress-basico-v2

Sample project for the basic course of the Talking About Tested.

# Pre-requirements
It is required to have Node.js and npm installed to run this project.

I used versions v18.16.1 and 9.5.1 of Node.js and npm, respectively. I suggest you use the same or later versions.

# Installation
Run npm install (or npm i for the short version) to install the dev dependencies.

# Tests
Use 'npm run headless' (or npm t for the short version) to run the test in headless mode.

Or, 'npm run open' to open Cypress in interactive mode.

# Tests Mobile with Width=410 Height=860
Use 'npm run headless mobile' to run the test in headless mode.

Or 'npm run mobile' to open Cypress in interactive mode.
